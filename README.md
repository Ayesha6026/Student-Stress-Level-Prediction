# Student-Stress-Level-Prediction

In this project, we have developed a stress level prediction system from student data using supervised learning techniques. First, we analyzed student data to extract useful features. For example, we investigate how stress level of a student is impacted by social or environmental factors and which factor has the greater impact. Then we trained different ML models to predict the stress level accurately. Finally, We used validation matrices to compare and tune our model.
